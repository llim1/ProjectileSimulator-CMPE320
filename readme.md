The proposed application is a physics simulation that models the behaviour of non-Newtonian projectiles in a range of different environments (planets). The project will focus both on the algorithms/physics behind non-Newtonian motion, in addition to demonstrating the concepts through a user-friendly interface. Users can select the activity and environment, and travel through “space” on their rocket, exploring the various activities as a cartoon astronaut.

This repository stores all code pertaining to the proposed application.
